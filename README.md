* This program is a solution to part an excercise from a youtube channel CodeWithHarry (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) from the playlist : Python tutorials
for absolute beginners.
* This program basically logs in the the date and time of excercise and food you give to it and you can retrieve it later to see your history. This program can be used for many 
other purposes too!
